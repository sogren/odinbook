### Features

You can create your own account, make new friends, make posts on yours or on your friends timeline and comment all of it. To make new friends you need to invite them first and of course they need to accept your invitaiton, so you need to have link to their profile first. And you can upload your own profile picture and add some informaitons about you to your profile! Its almost as good as facebook! I only need to spend three more years on this and find 2 billions of users...
